/**
 * Native startup wiring for the embedded runtime (the `.web.ts` sibling is a no-op — web is always
 * remote). Injects the built comical packages — `@comical/host-server`'s `createRouter` and
 * `@comical/registry`'s fetcher, imported from their Node-free subpaths — into the embedded runtime,
 * then installs the embedded transport if the persisted preference says on-device (and the native
 * engine is present). Safe to call when the native module isn't linked: it resolves to remote.
 *
 * Called once from `_layout.tsx` at app launch. This is the single place the app depends on the
 * comical submodule at runtime; Metro bundles these subpaths on native only (see metro.config.js).
